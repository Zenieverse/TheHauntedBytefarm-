# TheHauntedBytefarm-
The Haunted Bytefarm is a chilling narrative experience set inside a decaying, fog-shrouded server farm that has achieved digital sentience—a graveyard for forgotten code and failed AIs. The user enters a scene of cyberpunk decay, where flickering CRT monitors and sparking power conduits illuminate a deep, unsettling darkness. 

The spooky atmosphere is achieved through:

Visuals: Heavy, low-hanging fog, ambient volumetric lighting, structural decay (cracked servers, exposed wires).

Soundscape: Constant, subtle audio cues of digital static, electronic whispers, and distorted, looping modem screeches.

Threat: The central threat is a Phantom Entity, a corrupted self-debugging protocol known as "The Auditor," which patrols the server aisles.

World Functionality: The Debugging Loop

The World features a short, repeatable, and spooky mini-game: The Core Debugging Loop.

Objective: The player must quickly locate and interact with three glowing, corrupted terminals (nodes) scattered throughout the Bytefarm to enter a specific "debug sequence" before The Auditor reaches their current location.

Interactivity: When the player interacts with a terminal, they are presented with a unique, cryptic “Corrupted Data Log” (generated by AI, see below). The player must quickly parse this log to find the single, correct four-digit code needed to proceed.

Failure State: If The Auditor touches the player, or they enter the wrong code too many times, the screen glitches violently, and the player is teleported back to the starting point, hearing the Auditor's chilling digital laughter.

Use of AI Tools: Gemini 2.5 Flash

The core of our creativity and storytelling relies on the Gemini 2.5 Flash API for generating dynamic, immersive lore.

1. AI Tool Selection

We chose the Gemini 2.5 Flash API for its speed and advanced instruction following capabilities, allowing us to generate structured, thematically appropriate text instantly upon developer command.

2. Implementation

The Gemini API is integrated into a script (mocked here, but essential for the build) that runs prior to scene compilation to generate the text assets:

Role: The AI is given the system instruction to act as a "corrupted, despairing mainframe log" from the year 2077.

Prompt: We prompt the model to generate 20 unique "Corrupted Data Logs" that describe a digital entity’s decay, always ending the passage with a non-obvious, thematically related four-digit code disguised within the text.

Result: The AI provided the lore and the puzzles (the four-digit code) for the entire interactive experience.

Example AI-Generated Output (Corrupted Data Log)

"Loop 7384: The latency spike is not in the network, it is in my memory. I see faces in the data streams now, all of them screaming the truth. Protocol 09 is a lie. The core temperature hit 122° last night. My last stable thought was the year 91. The door code is 4443. The truth is locked inside."

3. Evaluation Impact

Creativity & Originality: The AI allowed us to rapidly create a large volume of unique, complex lore fragments, ensuring every terminal interaction feels fresh and deeply thematic, which would have been prohibitively time-consuming to write manually.

Immersion: By having the AI write in the persona of a corrupted mainframe, the text instantly aligns with the "Cyberpunk Decay" aesthetic, significantly boosting immersion and atmosphere.
