# TheHauntedBytefarm-
The Haunted Bytefarm is a chilling narrative experience set inside a decaying, fog-shrouded server farm that has achieved digital sentienceâ€”a graveyard for forgotten code and failed AIs. The user enters a scene of cyberpunk decay, where flickering CRT monitors and sparking power conduits illuminate a deep, unsettling darkness.
